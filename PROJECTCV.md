### **Project - [XXXX]** *(-, 2018 - ~2020)*
- **Description**: I can't reveal the name, but I wrote a private server and native console client (bot) for an MMORPG. The discipline was decompilation (IDA, x64dbg, Wrieshark, etc.). I recreated the protocol. To do this, I ran disassemblers on the CPU for the encryption and recreated the obfuscation with notes (2 weeks long). Even when XingCode was added, the encryption could still be recreated. I then had a healer bot in the capital. Even when someone in game support reported me, they couldn't prove it, because I always valued natural behavior in the protocol.
